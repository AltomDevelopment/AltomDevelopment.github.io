            Dynamic and disciplined bodybuilder with over 10 years of experience in the fitness industry. Starting my career in highschool as a football player,
            I stayed with bodybuilding while joining the Army as an Airborne Infantryman in the 82nd and continued to bodybuild whenever I could. After leaving the 
            service and going to college full time for Computer Science I slowly began to transition into an even heavier bodybuilding focused regiment which 
            has lead me to where I am today with my fitness. i am an Expert in strength training and hypertrophy techniques along with contest preperation.

        <p>
            Ensuring that I maintain a good ethic throughout my career and lifts along with my overall commitment to the industry, I strive to become the best competitor
            that I can when it comes time to set my foot on stage. Passionate about mentoring fellow athletes and promoting fitness education, I have acquire my personal 
            training certificate through the accredited International Sports Sciences Association (ISSA) and have been working with clients for over 5 years. Dedicated to 
            continuous personal development and contributing to the evolution of bodybuilding, I hope to leave my name as a public figure within the sport.
